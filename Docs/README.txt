Producing documents with LaTeX requires a good bit of infrastructure that
many developers don't have. I use an interactive gui-based tool called
TeXstudio, which is part of the TeX LIve distribution
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/).

Recently, Masataro Asai contributed a Makefile for producing the geco*.pdf
documents, and with the release of GECO 2.1.2, I've added some discussion
of the contents of this Docs directory.

Note that building the hyperlinked version of the documentation requires
making some very simple edits to the geco.tex file. See the comments near
the beginning of the file.
